## Working of PaaS

	* After Purchasing PaaS Setup we can now login and download all the necessary SDE's and can start building our own application/product.
 
	* PaaS allows us to focus on building our applications rather that setting up the environments required for building the application.

## Components Provided by PaaS

	* Database Management
 
	* Operating System
 
	* Deployment tools
 
	* Infrastructure
 
	* some vendors may provide even more based on requirements

 ## Types of PaaS
### Public PaaS
	* This can be accessible by everyone.
	* We will only pay for what we have used.
	* some of the Providers are AWS, Google cloud.
### private PaaS
	* This is like building our own infrastructure which is required.
	* This provides more Security and control.
### Hybrid PaaS
	* This is like we control the resources based on the own choice and preferences.
	* This is more flexible & cost effective.
	
## Advantages of PaaS
	* Low Cost: We have lend the resources from the vendors without building them.
	* Time Saving: we don't need to spend time on security, Software updates and infrastructure building.
	* Same Environment: Once we get our desired PaaS it allows us to do build,run,test,host all at same place.

## Disadvantages of PaaS

	* Vendor Dependency: we need depend on vendor Capabilities.
	* Integration Problems: Combining two PaaS products is impossible.
	* Security Risk: Since we are storing data in some other place we need have faith on vendor.
