# PaaS(Platform As A Service)
* Paas is one of the cloud computing models, which stands for Platform as a service model.
* PaaS is one of three service models in cloud computing, and the remaining two are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).

* PaaS provides an Operating system, Middleware/Database, and Runtime Service for developing, running, and managing applications.

## Working of PaaS

* After Purchasing PaaS Setup we can now log in and download all the necessary SDEs and can start building our application/product.
* PaaS allows us to focus on building our applications rather than setting up the environments required for building the application.

## Components Provided by PaaS

* Database Management
* Operating System
* Deployment tools
* Infrastructure
* some vendors may provide even more based on requirements

## Types of PaaS
 
### Public PaaS

* This can be accessible to everyone.  
* We will only pay for what we have used. 
* Some of the providers are AWS and Google Cloud.

### private PaaS

* This is like building our infrastructure which is required.  
* This provides more Security and control.
  
### Hybrid PaaS

* This is like we control the resources based on our own choices and preferences.
* This is more flexible & cost effective.
	
## Advantages of PaaS
* Low Cost: We have to lend the vendors' resources without building them.
* Time-saving: we don't need to spend time on security, Software updates, and infrastructure building.
* Same Environment: Once we get our desired PaaS it allows us to build, run, test, and host all at the same place.

## Disadvantages of PaaS

* Vendor Dependency: we need to depend on vendor Capabilities.
* Integration Problems: Combining two PaaS products is impossible.
* Security Risk: Since we are storing data in some other place we need to have faith in the vendor.
