* Using tools like CodePen and CodeSandbox to share entire setups.
* Using tools like TimeLimit and Freedom to control social media usage during working hours.
* Following the principle Work when you work, play when you play for better focus and productivity.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas for making progress in that area?
I think I need to improve my focus during working hours for better productivity and to reduce social media usage during working hours.
To improve this thing I will try to implement the following:

* Take notes on tasks to track work and progress more efficiently.
* Use apps like TimeLimit and Freedom to control social media usage during working hours.
* Interact with teammates to gain a better understanding of the product and tech stack.
