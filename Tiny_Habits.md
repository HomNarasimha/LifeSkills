# Tiny Habits
## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In the video, I found the concept of building tiny habits after completing existing ones particularly interesting.
By breaking habits down into small, manageable actions and incorporating them into our daily routine, we can achieve results more easily and effectively.


## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* B = MAP is a formula that explains behavior is a result of Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. 
* To make forming new habits easier, we can apply B = MAP by breaking the habit into small, simple tasks that can be completed in 30 seconds or less. 
* Additionally, we can perform these tiny habits immediately after an existing habit to create a seamless connection.
* In B = MAP: M stands for Motivation, A stands for Ability, and P stands for Prompt.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 
It is important to celebrate after each successful completion of a habit because:
* It increases our motivation.
* It encourages us to repeat the habit.
* It boosts our confidence.
* It creates success momentum.
* It enables us to tackle more difficult tasks.
* It helps us build habits more easily and effectively.
## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The story of the Ship of Theseus is interesting because, over time, its old planks are replaced with new ones. Eventually, the ship looks completely new, even though itâ€™s the same one.

This is a great example of personal change. Just like the ship, we can change our identity by replacing old habits with new ones. Over time, these new habits help shape a new identity for us.
## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
* Identity is key to changing any habit or solving any system because it provides a new perspective on how we approach things.
* Most people work from outcome to identity, but we should focus on working from identity to outcome.
* The best way to change your identity is by building habits that align with your identity.
* We often work from outcome to identity, but the more effective approach is to work from identity to outcome.
* To solve systemic problems, we need to change our identity.
* The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when habits become part of our identity.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
* Create an environment that supports and encourages the start of your habit.
* Make your habit enjoyable and attractive so that it becomes something you look forward to doing every time.
* Keep your habit as simple as possible, making it easy to accomplish.
* Ensure that your habit is immediately rewarded.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
* Being in an environment that makes it difficult to start your habit can make you skip it.
* Making your habit boring and unpleasant will make it harder to repeat consistently.
* Making your habit more complicated to perform will reduce your chances of success.
* If your habit is unsatisfying and feels unachievable, it will demotivate you from trying it again

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
* I would like to incorporate daily book reading into my routine.
* To start, I will read one motivational quote immediately after checking my phone.
* I will choose quotes that help me stay motivated, especially when I am feeling low.
* Over time, I plan to extend this habit by reading one page of a book after both lunch and dinner, without checking my phone


## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
* I would like to reduce my social media usage to one hour daily.
* To implement it I will stop using my phone after meals and take a rest instead.
* I will also stop using my phone one hour before going to bed.
* Over time, I plan to reduce my usage by only checking social media when I'm feeling bored.
