# Grit and Growth Mindset

## 1. Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.
Performance does not depend on a person's IQ; it depends on effort. To become successful in any area, one needs to have grit, which is a combination of passion and perseverance, rather than having talent, 
social intelligence, looks, or other qualities. Grit is like running a marathon toward achieving long-term goals, fueled by passion, energy, and continuous self-evaluation.
Grit is not directly related to talent, and in some cases, it may even be inversely related to it. There is no specific way to build grit, but it can be developed through a growth mindset.

Mindsets are generally of two types: Fixed Mindsets and Growth Mindsets, both of which play a crucial role in anyone's success.
A Growth Mindset is the belief in our capacity to learn and grow, whereas a Fixed Mindset is sticking to the things you are already good at or know.
A Growth Mindset encourages focusing on the process, while a Fixed Mindset is all about performance and outcomes.
A Growth Mindset helps you use effort, challenges, mistakes, and feedback positively, whereas these are considered negatively in a Fixed Mindset.
